# Design Specification Automation System



##  Summary

The **Design Specs Automation System** is an AI-powered design specification assistant that automates the process of competitive analysis and UX flow design for Android applications. The system leverages Google's Gemini AI models to analyze competitor apps, extract screen flows, and generate production-ready app flow trees based on best UX practices for the final design specification document generation.

### Key Value Proposition
- **Automated Competitive Intelligence**: Identifies top 10 competitor apps with 100K+ downloads
- **Screen Flow Extraction**: Analyzes competitor UX patterns from verified sources (Mobbin platform) and the web authentic sources as fallback
- **AI-Driven Flow Design**: Generates complete, hierarchical app flow trees for new products
- **Time Savings**: Reduces weeks of manual research to minutes of automated analysis

## 🔄 System Workflow

### Phase 1: User Input Collection
**Interface:** Streamlit Web UI  
**Inputs Required:**
1. **App Name** - Name of the target application
2. **App Description** - Brief description of app purpose and features
3. **PRD Document** - PDF upload (optional for future enhancements)


### Phase 2: Competitive Analysis
**Module:** `competitive_analysis.py`  
**AI Model:** Gemini 2.5-Flash  
**Process:**
1. Analyzes app description to determine market category
2. Searches authoritative sources (Google Play Store, data.ai, Sensor Tower, SimilarWeb)
3. Applies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for similarity evaluation
4. Filters apps with <100K downloads
5. Returns exactly 10 unique competitor apps

**Output Schema:**
```json
{
  "apps": [
    {
      "app_name": "Official App Name",
      "estimated_download_count": 1000000
    }
  ]
}
```
**Prompt Engineering Techniques Used**

| Technique | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** | Instructs the model to internally reason step-by-step to assess functional and semantic similarity between apps. |
| **Step-back Reasoning** | Directs the model to reassess borderline or uncertain cases for higher accuracy and reliability. |
| **Role Prompting** | Defines the model’s persona as a “world-class Android app market research specialist” to anchor expertise and domain tone. |

**Advanced Features:**
- Thinking budget: 8192 tokens for deep reasoning
- Deduplication by package ID and app name


### Phase 3: Screen Flow Extraction
**Module:** `flow_tree_service.py`  
**AI Model:** Gemini 2.5-Pro  
**Data Source:** Mobbin platform (UX flow repository) and Web

**Process:**
1. Searches each competitor app on Mobbin if available or the web
2. Navigates to Flows section
3. Extracts complete flow trees (unified or individual flows)
4. Captures every screen, user action, and transition
5. Validates structural integrity (no broken links, no dead ends)

**Output Schema:**
```json
{
  "apps_screen_flows": [
    {
      "app_name": "string",
      "app_screen_flows": [
        {
          "flow_name": "string",
          "screens": [
            {
              "screen_name": "string",
              "actions": [
                {
                  "user_action": "string",
                  "next_screen": "string"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Prompt Engineering Techniques Used**

| Technique | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** | Encourages structured, multi-step internal reasoning to accurately extract and validate complete app flow trees. |
| **Few-shot Prompting** | Provides illustrative examples (e.g., partial Instagram flow) to guide the model’s output structure and style. |
| **Role Prompting** | Defines the model’s persona as a “Senior Mobile UX Research Analyst and Product Flow Architect” to ensure domain expertise and consistency. |


**Quality Assurance:**
- Every flow has ≥1 screen
- Every screen has ≥1 action
- All transitions are valid and resolvable
- No hallucinated or inferred flows


### Phase 4: Custom App Flow Tree Generation
**Module:** `app_flow.py`  
**AI Model:** Gemini 2.5-Pro with Google Search  
**Reasoning Technique:** Tree-of-Thought Expansion

**Process:**
1. **Deep Understanding**: Extracts core value proposition from app description
2. **Competitor Analysis**: Identifies common UX patterns and differentiation opportunities
3. **Flow Synthesis**: Explores 3-5 alternative flow paths per user goal
4. **Validation**: Ensures hierarchical completeness and UX best practices
5. **Output**: Production-ready flow tree in strict JSON format

**Output Schema:**
```json
{
  "app_flow_tree": {
    "app_name": "string",
    "based_on_competitors": ["app1", "app2", ...],
    "app_screen_flows": [
      {
        "flow_name": "string",
        "screens": [
          {
            "screen_name": "string",
            "actions": [
              {
                "user_action": "string",
                "next_screen": "string"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
**Prompt Engineering Techniques Used**
| Technique | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** | Guides the model through structured multi-phase internal reasoning (Understanding → Analysis → Synthesis → Validation → Output) for coherent and logical flow generation. |
| **Tree-of-Thought (ToT)** | Expands reasoning by exploring multiple alternative flow paths before selecting the most optimal one, ensuring creativity and depth in UX structure design. |
| **Role Prompting** | Assigns the model a precise expert persona — “Senior Mobile UX Flow Architect and Product Designer” — to align reasoning, tone, and output with domain expertise. |

**UX Principles Applied:**
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Discoverability and retention
- Minimal cognitive load
