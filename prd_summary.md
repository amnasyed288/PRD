### 2. Key Features & Functionality

**Core Generation Features:**

*   **Text-to-Music:**
    *   **Description:** Generates complete songs from simple text prompts (e.g., "a happy birthday song in pop style").
    *   **User Controls:** User inputs text prompt, selects genre, mood, or vocals.
    *   **Process:** AI first generates lyrics, then the full song (melody, instruments, vocals).
    *   **UX Considerations:** Needs a prominent text input area, clear selection options for musical parameters, and a visible generation progress indicator.
    *   **Constraint:** Must manage potential misuse from inappropriate/offensive text prompts.
*   **Photo-to-Music:**
    *   **Description:** Transforms photos into mood-based music tracks.
    *   **User Controls:** User uploads or takes a photo, then crops it. User selects Mood and Genre.
    *   **Process:** AI analyzes the image (colors, emotions, context), generates lyrics first, then an AI song matching the photo's style and genre.
    *   **UX Considerations:** Requires an intuitive photo capture/upload interface, cropping functionality, and clear mood/genre selection.
    *   **Constraint:** Requires careful handling of user photo privacy and robust error handling for uploads.
*   **Studio Mode (Personalized Generation):**
    *   **Description:** Allows creation of custom, personalized songs for specific people and occasions.
    *   **User Controls:** User inputs Name, Relation, Occasion (optional), an additional text prompt, and selects preferred style/genre (pop, rock, lo-fi, EDM, etc.).
    *   **Process:** AI analyzes all inputs, generates lyrics, then personalized music.
    *   **UX Considerations:** Needs clear, guided input fields for personalized details, and a wide range of genre/style choices. Interface must balance advanced features with ease of use for beginners.
    *   **Constraint:** Performance on mid/low-end devices must be considered due to potential complexity.
*   **AI Generated Lyrics & Editing:**
    *   **Description:** AI generates lyrics from prompts (text/photos), with options to edit, rewrite, or enhance. Supports syncing lyrics with generated music for display.
    *   **User Controls:** User inputs prompt/theme; AI generates lyrics; user can then edit individual lines or regenerate.
    *   **Constraint:** Lyrics are currently restricted to English only.
    *   **Constraint:** Users are *unable to change timestamps* for synced lyrics.
    *   **UX Considerations:** A robust text editing interface, regeneration options, and a clear display for synced lyrics (e.g., karaoke-style). Content moderation for biased/offensive lyrics is crucial.
*   **Music Generation Screen with Queue Handling:**
    *   **Description:** A centralized screen to manage multiple concurrent song generations and downloads.
    *   **Functionality:** Displays all pending generations, their progress, and status. Allows users to cancel ongoing generations. Optionally, allows regeneration if an error occurs. Supports manual and auto-sync for cancelled/due songs.
    *   **Constraint:** Song generation is dependent on user 'Credits'.
    *   **UX Considerations:** Requires a clear, visual queue management UI with progress bars, status labels (pending, processing, completed, error), and actionable buttons (cancel, regenerate, download, share). Notifications are critical when songs are ready.

**Support & Discovery Features:**

### 5. Design Requirements

*   **Intuitive Interface:** The Studio Mode, in particular, requires an intuitive interface that caters to both beginners (to avoid overwhelm) and more advanced users. This implies progressive disclosure of complexity or different modes.
*   **Clear Visual Feedback:**
    *   **Queue Management:** Clear UI to show generation progress, current status (pending, processing, complete, error), and estimated wait times.
    *   **AI Understanding:** Visual cues to convey how AI is interpreting user inputs (mood, genre, style) from text or photos.
    *   **Lyric Sync:** Clear and readable display of synchronized lyrics (karaoke-style).
*   **Seamless User Experience:** Smooth UX for importing, editing, and saving audio, minimizing friction.
*   **Diversity & Exploration:** Design for "Inspire Me" should emphasize diversity of suggestions (genres, moods, styles) to encourage exploration and prevent repetition.
*   **Trust & Transparency:** UI should help build user trust in the AI's capabilities, especially concerning lyrical fit to emotion and prompt understanding.
*   **Branding & Aesthetics:** While not explicitly defined, the "fun" and "accessible" nature implies a need for an engaging, modern, and user-friendly visual design.
*   **Accessibility:** Adherence to standard mobile accessibility guidelines for contrast, touch target sizes, and screen reader compatibility.

### 6. Business Rules & Logic

*   **Credit System:** User song generation capabilities are limited by "Credits." The app must clearly communicate credit usage and availability.
*   **Content Moderation:** Strict rules for filtering inappropriate, offensive, or culturally insensitive content in both text prompts and generated lyrics.
*   **Copyright Protection:** Measures to prevent generation of lyrics too similar to existing copyrighted songs. Implicitly, users should be warned about legal risks when remixing copyrighted device audio.
*   **Language Support:** Initial lyric generation and editing is restricted to English. This is a critical constraint for UX.
*   **Content Library Management:** A strategy to keep the default song content library updated and diverse, ensuring accurate categorization.
*   **Server Load Management:** The queue system and potentially credit limits serve as business mechanisms to manage server load and prevent system instability.
*   **User Privacy:** Strict adherence to privacy policies, especially concerning user-uploaded photos and device audio files.
*   **Optional Features:** "Fetch Device Audios" is explicitly marked as "Optional," indicating a potential staged rollout or lower initial priority.
